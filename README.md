    SCPEQX/: It contains the SCPEQX module, the automated model constructor module and all the examples of the test suite; each example comprises a pair of source and transformed programs, that of the corresponding models and the corresponding output produced by the SCPEQX module.
    DCPEQX/: It contains the DCPEQX module, the automated model constructor and a copy of the same set of examples as provided under the subdirectory “SCPEQX”.
    FSMDEQX/: This subdirectory includes two versions of the finite state machine models with data paths (FSMD) based equivalence checking method – one with path extension (PE) capability and the other with value propagation (VP) capability. The examples in the test suite given in the above two subdirectories where parallelizing transformations are applied are not included in the example list given here. Other examples as given under SCPEQX subdirectory are included.
    CPN_tool/: It contains the well known CPN tool [1] as well as all the models – both hand constructed ones and those constructed by the automated model constructor – which are tested using this tool
